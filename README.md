# route-planning-iOS-app
This is the first attempt to build the route planning app.
It was built with SwiftUI and includes some experimentation with different UI Designs.
I decided it would be easier to start from scratch to better conform to MVVM design pattern.

This is an iOS app to help users plan the best routes.
